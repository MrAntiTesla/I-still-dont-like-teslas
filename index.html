    <p>My favorite hobby is building slot cars on roblox (like the image above). I find it very fun because you can make whatever you want. For example, you could make a 700+ horsepower Ford Mustang with a LSD and no front bumper with a massive turbo sticking out of the hood. (my next project) When I finish all of my school work I like to spend my freetime making these cars and testing them. I put them all in my game to use with my friends. To me, building cars is calming because nobody is stoping you from making anything that you want. There is also a massive community of ROBLOX builders who also make racing or show cars. There is always something new that you can learn. I have been making ROBLOX cars for around half a year. I usually like to make drift cars because they are the hardest to build. You have to adjust the grip so most of it's at the front tires and there is less to the rear tires. You also need to adjust the suspension so there isnt any bodyroll. Overall it's not the easiest thing to do. That's why I love building cars so much. I always love a good challenge.</p>
